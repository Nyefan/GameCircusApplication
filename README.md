# GameCircusApplication

This code was written as part of the application process to GameCircus.
Q1 and Q2 are independent of each other and tested through TestBench.cpp.
The Elevator classes that are more than just skeletons were completed by me,
and the remaining classes were intended to be assumed complete.
